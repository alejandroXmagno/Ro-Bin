# Stuck Prevention & Recovery System

## üéØ Problem Fixed

**Issue:** Rover was getting stuck in certain paths and unable to make progress, requiring manual intervention.

**Symptoms:**
- Robot stops moving but nav goal is still active
- Robot oscillates back and forth in tight spaces
- Robot tries repeatedly to reach unreachable goals
- Robot gets trapped in corners or narrow passages

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Stuck Detection System**
Monitors robot movement continuously to detect when it's stuck.

**How it works:**
- Tracks last 20 positions (10 seconds of history)
- Calculates total movement every 0.5 seconds
- If robot moves less than **0.2m in 5 seconds** while goal is active ‚Üí STUCK!
- Requires 5 consecutive stuck detections (2.5 seconds) to trigger recovery

### 2. **Automatic Recovery Behavior**
When stuck is detected, robot automatically recovers.

**Recovery sequence:**
1. üö® Detect stuck condition
2. üìç Blacklist current location (avoid returning)
3. ‚õî Cancel current navigation goal
4. ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Back up 0.2m/s for 2 seconds
5. üîÑ Rotate 90¬∞ at 0.5 rad/s for 1.5 seconds
6. ‚úÖ Resume exploration with new goal

### 3. **Location Blacklisting**
Prevents returning to problematic areas.

**Features:**
- Remembers last 20 stuck locations
- Avoids selecting frontiers within **2.0m** of blacklisted spots
- Automatically clears old blacklist entries
- Falls back to non-blacklisted goals if needed

### 4. **Smart Frontier Selection**
Enhanced goal selection to avoid stuck-prone areas.

**Filtering:**
- ‚ùå Recently explored frontiers (1.5m radius)
- ‚ùå Near blacklisted locations (2.0m radius)
- ‚ùå Frontiers that previously caused stuck situations
- ‚úÖ Only selects safe, reachable frontiers

## üîß Technical Implementation

### New State Variables
```python
self.last_positions = deque(maxlen=20)  # Position history
self.stuck_count = 0                     # Stuck detection counter
self.blacklisted_goals = []              # Problematic locations
self.recovery_in_progress = False        # Recovery flag
```

### Stuck Detection Algorithm
```python
# Track movement over 5 seconds
total_movement = sum(distances between consecutive positions)

# Detect stuck
if total_movement < 0.2m:
    stuck_count++
    if stuck_count >= 5:  # 2.5 seconds stuck
        initiate_recovery()
```

### Recovery Maneuver
```python
1. Blacklist current location
2. Cancel navigation goal
3. cmd_vel = (-0.2, 0) for 2s  # Back up
4. cmd_vel = (0, 0.5) for 1.5s # Rotate
5. cmd_vel = (0, 0)             # Stop
6. Clear position history
7. Resume exploration
```

### Blacklist Checking
```python
def is_near_blacklisted(frontier):
    for blacklisted_location in blacklisted_goals:
        if distance(frontier, blacklisted_location) < 2.0m:
            return True  # Skip this frontier
    return False
```

## üìä Before vs After

### Before (Getting Stuck)
```
Robot ‚Üí Goal in tight space ‚Üí Stuck oscillating
      ‚Üí Timeout eventually (120s wasted)
      ‚Üí Might select same area again
      ‚Üí Repeat cycle ‚ùå
```

### After (Automatic Recovery)
```
Robot ‚Üí Goal ‚Üí Stuck detected (5s)
      ‚Üí Auto recovery (3.5s)
      ‚Üí Blacklist location
      ‚Üí New safe goal
      ‚Üí Continue exploring ‚úÖ
```

---

## üöÄ Usage

The system is automatic - no configuration needed!

### Build & Run
```bash
cd ~/rover_workspace
colcon build --packages-select rover_exploration
source install/setup.bash

# Terminal 1: Gazebo
ros2 launch roverrobotics_gazebo 2wd_rover_gazebo.launch.py

# Terminal 2: Navigation
ros2 launch rover_exploration navigation_stack_only.launch.py
```

### What You'll See

**Normal Operation:**
```
üó∫Ô∏è  Frontier goal at (5.23, -2.45) - 6.78m away
Goal in progress... (30s elapsed)
‚úÖ Navigation goal completed!
```

**When Stuck Detected:**
```
üö® Robot appears stuck! Moved only 0.058m in 5s
üîÑ Initiating recovery behavior...
Blacklisted location: (3.45, -1.23)
‚¨ÖÔ∏è Backing up...
üîÑ Rotating to find new path...
‚úÖ Recovery maneuver complete
Searching for new exploration goal...
üó∫Ô∏è  Frontier goal at (7.12, 2.34) - 8.45m away
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tuning Parameters

You can adjust sensitivity by modifying the code:

### Stuck Detection Sensitivity

**More Sensitive (detect stuck faster):**
```python
# In check_if_stuck():
if total_movement < 0.3:  # Was 0.2
    self.stuck_count += 1
    if self.stuck_count >= 3:  # Was 5
```

**Less Sensitive (avoid false positives):**
```python
if total_movement < 0.15:  # Was 0.2
    self.stuck_count += 1
    if self.stuck_count >= 7:  # Was 5
```

### Blacklist Radius

**Larger Avoidance Zone:**
```python
def is_near_blacklisted(self, frontier, threshold=3.0):  # Was 2.0
```

**Smaller Avoidance Zone:**
```python
def is_near_blacklisted(self, frontier, threshold=1.5):  # Was 2.0
```

### Recovery Maneuver

**More Aggressive:**
```python
backup_cmd.linear.x = -0.3  # Was -0.2
for _ in range(30):          # Was 20 (back up longer)

rotate_cmd.angular.z = 0.7   # Was 0.5 (rotate faster)
for _ in range(20):          # Was 15 (rotate more)
```

## üîç Monitoring & Debugging

### Check Blacklisted Locations
Add this to your code to print blacklist:
```python
self.get_logger().info(f'Blacklisted locations: {len(self.blacklisted_goals)}')
for loc in self.blacklisted_goals:
    self.get_logger().info(f'  - ({loc[0]:.2f}, {loc[1]:.2f})')
```

### Track Stuck Events
Count how often recovery triggers:
```python
# Add to __init__:
self.stuck_recovery_count = 0

# In initiate_recovery():
self.stuck_recovery_count += 1
self.get_logger().info(f'Recovery #{self.stuck_recovery_count}')
```

### Visualize in RViz
- Add **MarkerArray** topic to show blacklisted locations
- Publish red spheres at blacklisted coordinates
- See where robot previously got stuck

## üî¨ How It Detects Stuck vs Normal Behavior

### Normal Navigation (NOT Stuck)
```
Position tracking:
t=0s:  (0.0, 0.0)
t=1s:  (0.4, 0.1)  ‚Üê Moving
t=2s:  (0.8, 0.2)  ‚Üê Moving
t=3s:  (1.2, 0.3)  ‚Üê Moving
t=4s:  (1.6, 0.4)  ‚Üê Moving
t=5s:  (2.0, 0.5)  ‚Üê Total movement = 2.0m ‚úÖ OK!
```

### Stuck Situation (STUCK)
```
Position tracking:
t=0s:  (5.2, 3.1)
t=1s:  (5.21, 3.09) ‚Üê Barely moving
t=2s:  (5.19, 3.11) ‚Üê Oscillating
t=3s:  (5.20, 3.10) ‚Üê Oscillating
t=4s:  (5.21, 3.09) ‚Üê Oscillating
t=5s:  (5.19, 3.11) ‚Üê Total movement = 0.08m ‚ùå STUCK!
```

## üí° Why This Works

### 1. **Proactive vs Reactive**
- **Old:** Wait for timeout (120s wasted)
- **New:** Detect and recover in 5-8 seconds

### 2. **Memory of Failures**
- **Old:** Might try same problematic path again
- **New:** Remembers and avoids stuck locations

### 3. **Simple but Effective Recovery**
- Backing up gets out of tight space
- Rotation changes approach angle
- Together, these break stuck patterns

### 4. **Doesn't Interfere with Normal Nav**
- Only activates when truly stuck
- Lets Nav2 handle normal obstacles
- Complementary to existing safety checks

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Robot Triggers Recovery Too Often

**Cause:** Stuck detection too sensitive

**Fix:** Increase movement threshold or stuck count:
```python
if total_movement < 0.15:  # Lower threshold
    self.stuck_count += 1
    if self.stuck_count >= 8:  # Higher count
```

### Robot Doesn't Detect Stuck

**Cause:** Stuck detection not sensitive enough

**Fix:** Increase sensitivity:
```python
if total_movement < 0.25:  # Higher threshold
    self.stuck_count += 1
    if self.stuck_count >= 3:  # Lower count
```

### Recovery Maneuver Not Effective

**Cause:** Recovery too weak for the situation

**Fix:** Make recovery more aggressive:
```python
backup_cmd.linear.x = -0.4  # Back up faster
rotate_cmd.angular.z = 0.8  # Rotate faster
for _ in range(30):         # Do it longer
```

### Too Many Blacklisted Locations

**Cause:** Many areas triggering stuck detection

**Fix:** Either:
1. Reduce blacklist radius (less area blocked)
2. Increase blacklist limit (more locations remembered)
3. Clear blacklist more aggressively

## üéì Key Concepts

### Stuck Detection
- **Position History:** deque of last 20 positions
- **Movement Calculation:** Sum of Euclidean distances
- **Threshold:** 0.2m in 5 seconds
- **Confirmation:** 5 consecutive detections

### Recovery Strategy
- **Phase 1:** Back up (escape tight space)
- **Phase 2:** Rotate (change approach angle)
- **Phase 3:** Resume (try different direction)

### Blacklisting
- **Purpose:** Avoid repeating failures
- **Radius:** 2.0m around stuck location
- **Duration:** Until blacklist full (20 locations)
- **Priority:** Recent stuck locations prioritized

## ‚úÖ Summary

The rover now has an **intelligent stuck detection and recovery system**:

1. ‚úÖ Automatically detects when stuck (5-8 seconds)
2. ‚úÖ Executes recovery maneuver (3.5 seconds)
3. ‚úÖ Remembers problematic locations
4. ‚úÖ Avoids returning to stuck areas
5. ‚úÖ Continues exploration without manual intervention

**Result:** Rover completes full exploration runs without getting permanently stuck! üéâ

## üìû Need Help?

If robot still gets stuck:
1. Check Nav2 parameters (controller settings)
2. Verify map quality (SLAM working properly)
3. Adjust stuck detection sensitivity
4. Make recovery more aggressive
5. Check for mechanical issues

The stuck prevention system is a **safety net** - it helps, but proper Nav2 tuning is still important!
