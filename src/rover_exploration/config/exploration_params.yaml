    # Exploration radius (meters) - how far to search for frontiers
    # INCREASED for better exploration coverage
    exploration_radius: 12.0
    
    # Frontier detection threshold - minimum distance between frontier cells
    # REDUCED for more granular detection
    frontier_threshold: 5
    
    # Minimum frontier cluster size - ignore small isolated frontiers
    # REDUCED to explore smaller areas too
    min_frontier_size: 3
    
    # Goal timeout (seconds) - abandon goal if not reached within this time
    # INCREASED to allow reaching distant frontiers
    goal_timeout: 90.0
    
    # Obstacle distance thresholds (meters) - Two-level obstacle avoidance
    # Using filtered LiDAR (/scan_filtered) so thresholds can be tighter
    # WARNING threshold: Cancel goal if obstacle within this distance for 1 second
    obstacle_distance_threshold: 0.4
    
    # CRITICAL threshold: Immediate emergency cancel if obstacle this close
    critical_obstacle_threshold: 0.25
    
    # Minimum interval between goals (seconds)
    # REDUCED to move faster between goals and prevent getting stuck
    min_goal_interval: 1.0
    
    # Random exploration probability - NOT CURRENTLY USED
    # Algorithm now uses frontier-based with random fallback
