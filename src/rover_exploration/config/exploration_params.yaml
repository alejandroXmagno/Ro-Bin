    # ============================================================
    
    # Exploration radius (meters) - how far to search for frontiers
    # Larger = looks further ahead, finds more distant unexplored areas
    # Smaller = stays closer to current position
    # Recommended: 6.0-10.0 for large environments, 3.0-5.0 for small
    exploration_radius: 8.0
    
    # Frontier detection threshold - minimum distance between frontier cells
    # Lower = more granular frontier detection
    frontier_threshold: 8
    
    # Minimum frontier cluster size - ignore small isolated frontiers
    # Prevents robot from chasing tiny unexplored gaps
    # Recommended: 3-10 depending on map resolution
    min_frontier_size: 5
    
    # Goal timeout (seconds) - abandon goal if not reached within this time
    # Should be long enough to reach distant frontiers
    # Increased to 120s to allow completion of long paths to unexplored areas
    goal_timeout: 120.0
    
    # Obstacle distance thresholds (meters) - Two-level obstacle avoidance
    # WARNING threshold: Cancel goal if obstacle within this distance for 1 second
    # Prevents robot from getting too close to walls
    obstacle_distance_threshold: 0.8
    
    # CRITICAL threshold: Immediate emergency cancel if obstacle this close
    # Prevents robot from hitting walls
    critical_obstacle_threshold: 0.5
    
    # Minimum interval between goals (seconds)
    # Prevents immediate new goal calculation after completion
    # Allows robot to settle and verify completion
    min_goal_interval: 3.0
    
    # Random exploration probability - NOT CURRENTLY USED
    # Algorithm now uses frontier-based with random fallback
    random_exploration_probability: 0.3
