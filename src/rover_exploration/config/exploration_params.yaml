    # ============================================================
    
    # Exploration radius (meters) - how far to search for frontiers
    # Larger = looks further ahead, finds more distant unexplored areas
    # Smaller = stays closer to current position
    # Recommended: 6.0-10.0 for large environments, 3.0-5.0 for small
    exploration_radius: 8.0
    
    # Frontier detection threshold - minimum distance between frontier cells
    # Lower = more granular frontier detection
    frontier_threshold: 8
    
    # Minimum frontier cluster size - ignore small isolated frontiers
    # Prevents robot from chasing tiny unexplored gaps
    # Recommended: 3-10 depending on map resolution
    min_frontier_size: 5
    
    # Goal timeout (seconds) - abandon goal if not reached within this time
    # Should be long enough to reach distant frontiers
    # Increase if robot keeps timing out before reaching goals
    goal_timeout: 45.0
    
    # Obstacle distance threshold (meters) - emergency stop distance
    # Robot stops if obstacle is closer than this
    obstacle_distance_threshold: 0.4
    
    # Random exploration probability - NOT CURRENTLY USED
    # Algorithm now uses frontier-based with random fallback
    random_exploration_probability: 0.3
