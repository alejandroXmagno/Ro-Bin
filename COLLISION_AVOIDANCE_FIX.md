# Aggressive Collision Avoidance & Stuck Prevention

## 🎯 Problems Fixed

**Issues:**
1. ❌ Robot hitting walls and obstacles
2. ❌ Getting stuck more frequently
3. ❌ Not cancelling paths early enough to avoid collisions
4. ❌ Too persistent, trying to reach unreachable goals

**Root Causes:**
- Obstacle threshold too close (0.3m - robot was already touching)
- Stuck detection too slow to react
- Recovery behavior too gentle
- Blacklist radius too small

---

## ✅ Solution: Multi-Layer Safety System

### 1. **Two-Level Obstacle Detection**

**CRITICAL Level (0.5m):**
- **Immediate emergency cancel** if obstacle < 0.5m
- No waiting, instant response
- Prevents collisions with walls

**WARNING Level (0.8m):**
- Cancel goal if obstacle within 0.8m for **1 second** (2 checks)
- Gives time to verify it's not a false detection
- Prevents getting too close to obstacles

```python
if distance < 0.5m:
    ⛔ IMMEDIATE CANCEL!
elif distance < 0.8m for 1 second:
    ⚠️  CANCEL to avoid collision
```

### 2. **Faster Stuck Detection**

**Before:**
- Required 5 seconds to detect
- Needed 2.5 seconds sustained
- 0.2m movement threshold

**After:**
- Detects in **4 seconds** (reduced from 5)
- Confirms in **1.5 seconds** (reduced from 2.5)
- **0.3m movement threshold** (increased from 0.2 to catch slower stuck)

```python
Movement in 4 seconds < 0.3m → Stuck detected in 1.5s
```

### 3. **More Aggressive Recovery**

**Before:**
- Back up 0.2m/s for 2s
- Rotate 90° slowly
- Total: ~3.5 seconds

**After:**
- Back up **0.3m/s for 3s** (50% faster, 50% longer)
- Rotate **135° at 0.6 rad/s** (45° more, 20% faster)
- Total: ~5.2 seconds (but more effective)

```python
Recovery:
  ⬅️ Back up: -0.3m/s × 3s = 0.9m (was 0.4m)
  🔄 Rotate:  0.6rad/s × 2.2s = 135° (was 90°)
```

### 4. **Wider Blacklist Avoidance**

**Before:** 2.0m radius around stuck locations
**After:** 3.0m radius around stuck locations

Avoids problematic areas more effectively, giving walls more berth.

## 🛡️ How It Works

### Collision Prevention Flow

```
Robot navigating to goal
    ↓
Scan data received (every 0.5s)
    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Check minimum distance      │
└─────────────────────────────┘
    ↓
< 0.5m? → ⛔ CRITICAL: Emergency cancel immediately!
    ↓ No
< 0.8m? → ⚠️  WARNING: Count++
    ↓        If count >= 2 (1 second): Cancel goal
    ↓ No
> 0.8m  → ✅ SAFE: Reset counter, continue
```

### Stuck Detection Flow

```
Robot navigating (position tracked every 0.5s)
    ↓
Last 4 seconds of positions stored
    ↓
Calculate total movement
    ↓
Movement < 0.3m? → Stuck count++
    ↓               If count >= 3 (1.5s): STUCK!
    ↓                   ↓
    ↓                   Initiate recovery:
    ↓                   1. Blacklist location
    ↓                   2. Cancel goal

## ⚙️ Tuning Guide

### Make Collision Avoidance MORE Conservative

**Increase safety distances:**
```yaml
obstacle_distance_threshold: 1.0  # Was 0.8
critical_obstacle_threshold: 0.6  # Was 0.5
```

**React faster:**
```python
# In safety_check(), reduce required checks:
if self.obstacle_count >= 1:  # Was 2 (instant cancel at warning level)
```

### Make Collision Avoidance LESS Conservative

**Reduce safety distances (not recommended):**
```yaml
obstacle_distance_threshold: 0.6  # Was 0.8
critical_obstacle_threshold: 0.4  # Was 0.5
```

### Adjust Stuck Detection Sensitivity

**More sensitive (detect faster):**
```python
if total_movement < 0.4:  # Was 0.3
    self.stuck_count += 1
    if self.stuck_count >= 2:  # Was 3
```

**Less sensitive (avoid false positives):**
```python
if total_movement < 0.25:  # Was 0.3
    self.stuck_count += 1
    if self.stuck_count >= 4:  # Was 3
```

### Adjust Recovery Aggressiveness

**More aggressive:**
```python
backup_cmd.linear.x = -0.4  # Was -0.3
for _ in range(40):         # Was 30 (4 seconds)

rotate_cmd.angular.z = 0.8  # Was 0.6
for _ in range(30):         # Was 22 (180° rotation)
```

**Less aggressive:**
```python
backup_cmd.linear.x = -0.2  # Was -0.3
for _ in range(20):         # Was 30 (2 seconds)

rotate_cmd.angular.z = 0.4  # Was 0.6
for _ in range(18):         # Was 22 (90° rotation)
```

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Obstacle Detection Algorithm

```python
valid_ranges = [r for r in scan.ranges if not inf and not nan]
min_distance = min(valid_ranges)

# Two-level checking:
if min_distance < 0.5m:
    # CRITICAL: immediate action
    cancel_goal()
    obstacle_count = 0
    return

if min_distance < 0.8m:
    # WARNING: sustained check
    obstacle_count++
    if obstacle_count >= 2:  # 1 second sustained
        cancel_goal()
        obstacle_count = 0
else:
    # SAFE: reset
    obstacle_count = 0
```

### Stuck Detection Algorithm

```python
# Track positions
positions = deque(maxlen=20)  # 10 seconds at 0.5Hz
positions.append(current_pose)

if len(positions) >= 8:  # 4 seconds minimum
    total_movement = sum_of_distances(positions)
    
    if total_movement < 0.3m:
        stuck_count++
        if stuck_count >= 3:  # 1.5 seconds sustained
            initiate_recovery()
```

### Blacklist Checking

```python
def is_near_blacklisted(frontier):
    for stuck_location in blacklisted_goals:
        distance = euclidean_distance(frontier, stuck_location)
        if distance < 3.0m:  # Increased from 2.0m
            return True
    return False
```

## 🛡️ Safety Layers

The robot now has **4 layers of safety**:

### Layer 1: Nav2 Local Costmap
- Built-in Nav2 obstacle avoidance
- Dynamic path replanning
- Still active and functional

### Layer 2: Critical Obstacle Detection (NEW)
- **< 0.5m:** Emergency cancel
- **Response:** 0.5 seconds
- **Purpose:** Prevent imminent collisions

### Layer 3: Warning Obstacle Detection (NEW)
- **< 0.8m for 1s:** Preventive cancel
- **Response:** 1 second
- **Purpose:** Avoid getting too close

### Layer 4: Stuck Detection & Recovery (IMPROVED)
- **< 0.3m movement in 4s:** Stuck detected
- **Response:** 5.5 seconds total
- **Purpose:** Escape stuck situations

---

## 💡 Why These Numbers?

### 0.8m Warning Threshold
- Typical lidar range uncertainty: ±0.05m
- Robot width: ~0.4m
- Safety margin: 0.35m
- **Total:** 0.8m ensures comfortable clearance

### 0.5m Critical Threshold
- Minimum safe distance for emergency stop
- Accounts for sensor lag and robot momentum
- Still provides small safety margin

### 0.3m Stuck Movement
- Normal slow navigation: >0.5m in 4s
- Stuck oscillation: 0.1-0.2m in 4s
- **Sweet spot:** 0.3m catches stuck without false positives

### 3.0m Blacklist Radius
- Robot needs turning radius: ~0.5m
- Obstacle avoidance margin: ~1.0m
- Safety buffer: ~1.5m
- **Total:** 3.0m ensures wide berth

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Robot Still Hits Walls

**Possible causes:**
1. Nav2 local costmap inflation too small
2. Lidar noise or blind spots
3. Moving obstacles not detected

**Solutions:**
1. Increase critical threshold:
   ```yaml
   critical_obstacle_threshold: 0.6  # Increase from 0.5
   ```
2. Reduce warning threshold check time:
   ```python
   if self.obstacle_count >= 1:  # Instant cancel
   ```
3. Check Nav2 costmap parameters

### Robot Cancels Goals Too Often

**Cause:** Too conservative thresholds

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce thresholds (carefully):
   ```yaml
   obstacle_distance_threshold: 0.7  # Reduce from 0.8
   ```
2. Increase required checks:
   ```python
   if self.obstacle_count >= 3:  # Increase from 2
   ```

### Robot Gets Stuck in Corners

**Cause:** Recovery not aggressive enough

**Solutions:**
1. Increase backup distance/speed
2. Increase rotation angle to 180°
3. Increase blacklist radius to 4.0m

### False Stuck Detections

**Cause:** Detection too sensitive

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce movement threshold:
   ```python
   if total_movement < 0.25:  # Reduce from 0.3
   ```
2. Require more confirmations:
   ```python
   if self.stuck_count >= 4:  # Increase from 3
   ```
